### Crew Automation plan designed to detect anomalies in financial transaction data and perform reconciliation based on specified criteria.

Automation Plan: Financial Transaction Anomaly Detection and Reconciliation
Objective: Develop a set of agents that will ingest financial transaction data, detect anomalies using predefined business rules, reconcile suspicious entries by cross-checking with historical expectations, and generate a comprehensive report for further analysis.

###### Output:

• A cleaned and structured dataset of financial transactions.
• A list of transaction anomalies flagged with relevant metrics.
• A reconciliation report outlining recommended corrective actions.
• A compiled dashboard/report for business review.

###### Inputs:

- \_ {financialdatapath}: Path or URL to your financial transactions data (e.g., CSV file).

###### Tools Selected:

- CSVSearchTool: Use to analyze and sift through CSV-formatted transaction data.

###### Agents and Tasks:

##### Data Ingestion Agent

- Role: Responsible for loading and cleaning the raw financial transactions data.
- Tasks:

  - Preprocess Financial Data:

    - Description: Ingest data from {financialdatapath} using CSVSearchTool and perform initial cleaning.
    - (Assigned to: Data Ingestion Agent)

  - Organize Transactions Data:
    - Description: Structure the cleaned data into {cleantransactionsdata} for further analysis.
    - (Assigned to: Data Ingestion Agent)

##### Anomaly Detection Agent

- Role: Analyzes the structured data to identify any deviations from the norm based on historical transaction patterns and thresholds.
- Tasks:

  - Analyze Data for Anomalies:

    - Description: Apply anomaly detection algorithms to {cleantransactionsdata} and identify transactions that significantly deviate from expectations. The outcomes are stored as {anomaly_list}.
    - (Assigned to: Anomaly Detection Agent)

  - Validate Anomalies Against Criteria:
    - Description: Filter out false positives by comparing each anomaly against {reconciliationrules}, refining the {anomalylist}.
    - (Assigned to: Anomaly Detection Agent)

##### Reconciliation Agent

- Role: Cross-check flagged anomalies against expected patterns and business rules to decide on necessary corrective actions.
- Tasks:

  - Cross-Check Anomalies with Financial Records:
    - Description: Using {anomalylist} and {reconciliationrules}, reconcile each anomaly by comparing them with historical data and expected transaction formats. The resulting actions and recommendations are stored in {reconciliation_report}.
    - (Assigned to: Reconciliation Agent)

##### Reporting Agent

- Role: Summarizes and presents the final outputs in a comprehensive report for decision-makers.
- Tasks:
  - Generate Comprehensive Report:
    - Description: Consolidate {cleantransactionsdata}, {anomalylist}, and {reconciliationreport} into a final report and dashboard detailing detected issues, the rationale behind each reconciliation decision, and overall system performance.
