### Crew Automation plan designed to detect anomalies in financial transaction data and perform reconciliation based on specified criteria.

Automation Plan: An end-to-end solution that accepts {historical_recon_data} and {current_recon_data} as inputs. LLMs and clustering techniques will detect anomalies, a classification agent will bucket them (marking any unknown reason as "new" with details), and a human-in-the-loop feedback tool will refine the system. An Agentic AI break resolution agent then provides concise summaries and Operator Assist Agents auto-initiate corrective actions (sending emails, creating tickets).

###### Output:

• Anomaly detection results
• Classification of detected anomalies into {predefined_buckets} (and marking new categories)
• Break resolution summaries using Agentic AI
• Automated actions (e.g., emails, ticket creation) for reconciliation breaks

###### Inputs:

• {historical_recon_data}: Historical reconciliation records
• {current_recon_data}: Live reconciliation details
• {predefined_buckets}: Set classification buckets for anomaly reasons
• {feedback_log}: Feedback from reconcilers identifying false positives/negatives

###### Tools Selected:

- CSVSearchTool: Use to analyze and sift through CSV-formatted transaction data.
- Interactive UI module – For feedback collection from reconcilers
- Communication integrations – Email and ticketing systems
